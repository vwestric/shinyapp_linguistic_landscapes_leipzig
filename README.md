# shinyapp_linguistic_landscapes_leipzig
This project is a result of the <a href='http://www.culingtec.uni-leipzig.de/ESU_C_T/'>European Summer University Leipzig</a> 2017 and 2018.

The data was collected by students of the course 'Humanities Data and Mapping Enviroments.' It aims to show the occurrences of non-german languages in Leipzig. This language may present itself on stickers, billboards, or any other kind of writing in the public sphere. 

The overlays show the distribution of citizens with immigration background in Leipzig, on district ('Stadtteil') and sub district ('Ortsteil') level.
